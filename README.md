# A Perceptive Markowitz Model ðŸ’¸ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘
Repo for "A Perceptive Markowitz Model" (AA222/CS361 Stanford Final)

A Perceptive Markowitz Model is a portfolio optimizer that takes a list of assets-of-interest and produces the optimal weights for each.  Stress no more about how to allocate your funds across a portfolio, APMM does it for you!  

You can opt to consider or not consider short-selling.  
You can also opt to calculate or not calculate best and worst case scenarios.

**INPUTS**: List of assets-of-interest (Ex: [GOOG, TSLA, NVDA, COST])
  - Practical Note: This model does not make any decisions for you regarding the assets you choose to buy.  The set of assets this model considers is 100% up to the best judgement of the user. You may educate your list of assets based on the news, historical data, or recommendations from your unemployed uncle.  The expected returns of the model are fundamentally influenced by the set of assets given as an input.  

**OUTPUTS**: 
1. list of recommended weights (Ex: [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1]) 
  - Constraint: all weights must sum to 1
  - If shorting is active, weights can be negative.  If shorting is inactive, weights must strictly be positive.
2. holding time: (Ex: 26 days)
3. best and worst case returns
  - Optional, requires simulations rather than a purely reactive model
