ðŸ’– Analyze a single portfolio design vector `[w..., t]`.

# Arguments
- `analyzer::Analyzer`: The analysis object containing static eval_space.
- `design::Vector{Float64}`: Portfolio design of length `n+1`:
  - First `n` entries are portfolio weights.
  - Last entry is `t`, the lookback period (number of days).

# Returns
- `expected_returns::Vector{Float64}`: t-day mean log return per asset.
- `cov_matrix::Matrix{Float64}`: t-day covariance matrix (nÃ—n).
- `portfolio_return::Float64`: Expected return of this portfolio over t days.
- `portfolio_volatility::Float64`: Portfolio volatility over t days.
- `sharpe_ratio::Float64`: Return-to-risk ratio (no risk-free rate assumed).
